Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?

Branches are a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate because it makes CI/CD easier.
If many engineers are on the same branch they may have to constantly pull to keep up with changes made by others. On the other hand if they use
different branches the developer can work with a concistent version of software and files creating less file conflicts.
Branches can also be used to control certain environments like prod and dev, engineres can use branches and merge/ pull requests as a way to test software
when the developer is ready for combining their code with the rest of the team. 
and prepare for production deployment
